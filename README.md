In this repository, we have included the following files:
1. Code file: NLI data man.sas
2. The following datasets:
-LST2015_2019_Nature_Tracts_Final.csv
-LST2019_Nature_Tracts_Cleaned.csv
-Nature_Disparities.xlsx
-StatewideNatureMetrics_Final.xls

Code is currently being revised to separate the data manipulation and analysis pieces into separate code documents and to remove code not required for analysis (e.g., QC checks). We will also be adding a data dictionary of the final analysis set.
